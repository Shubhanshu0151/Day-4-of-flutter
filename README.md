# Day 4 of 30:
### Today, I explored the SingleChildScrollView widget and the Navigator class in Flutter. Implementing SingleChildScrollView allowed me to make my login page scrollable, ensuring a seamless user experience on smaller screens. Additionally, I learned how to use Navigator for route management, enabling smooth navigation between different screens. Each of these components is crucial for building robust and user-friendly Flutter applications.

Stay tuned for more updates on my journey! ðŸš€ðŸ“±
